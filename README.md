# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Final Project

This repository contains part of the project work I completed during the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

Due to working across multiple environments (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and IBM Skills Network Labs), some of the notebooks were not saved locally and could not be uploaded.

However, all key steps — including data collection, wrangling, SQL analysis, EDA, predictive modeling, and dashboard creation — are fully documented in the submitted presentation (PDF format) and peer-reviewed assignments.

The uploaded notebooks include:
- Project 5: Python Data Analysis and Visualization
- Project 8: Dash Dashboard and Interactive Visualizations

Thank you for your understanding!
